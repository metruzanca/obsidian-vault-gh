# Obsidian Vault Github Template

Pre-configured to be compatible with Github/Github pages.

## Features
- **Github-Markdown Support**:
	- **Traditional links** instead of wiki links. (you can still use `[[]]` to quick create links, they'll just be converted). 
	- **Strict line breaks**. This makes it so that what you see in obsidian is what you see in github.
	- **Folder notes**: Github and other git-services use readme files the index files of folders (and repos) so using folder note configured with readme as the index file is perfect.
	- Obsidian Github Theme.
	- Files (`.md` & attachments) are created relative to the file you're currently editing.
- **Obsidian Git**: Publish updates from obsidian
- **Paste into Selection**: Select text and then paste links to auto-create links.
- **Quiet outline**: A better outline for editing big doc files.
- **Advanced Tables**: Table auto-formatting.
